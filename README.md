# Army Ranger Personnel Tracker
This project provides a database to hold the information and documents of soldiers in a consolidated and secure fashion. This database can be searched and sorted by multiple criteria pertaining to soldiers, such as rank, company, or name. This function is provided through a secured frontend with login functionality, including account restrictions on what data can be accessed and edited based on the role and rank of the user logged in.
